## Project Overview

TESSA is a personal portfolio project created to explore and implement a complete end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, from data preprocessing to training and evaluating a sophisticated deep learning model.

The project uses Twitter sentiment analysis as a practical case study to tackle the challenges of working with noisy, unstructured text. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with technologies like **Word2Vec** and **Bi-LSTMs** and to build a functional and accurate sentiment classification engine from the ground up. The project is relevant as "public opinion on platforms like Twitter is a goldmine of information for businesses" to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Skills & Features Demonstrated

* **High-Accuracy Sentiment Classification:** Successfully built a model that achieved **91% accuracy** in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments.
* **Advanced NLP Preprocessing:** Implemented a comprehensive text cleaning pipeline to handle the noisy nature of Twitter data (e.g., URLs, hashtags, mentions, stop words).
* **Semantic Word Embeddings:** Utilized **Word2Vec** to generate vector representations of words, capturing the semantic context and relationships between them to improve model performance.
* **Deep Learning Model:** Built and trained a **Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** network, demonstrating an understanding of recurrent neural networks for sequential data.

## Tech Stack & Libraries

* **Language:** Python
* **Core Data Science Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for metrics and evaluation)
* **NLP & Deep Learning:** TensorFlow (Keras), NLTK, Gensim (for Word2Vec)
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git

## Project Workflow

The project follows a systematic machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Loaded a dataset of 10,000+ tweets with pre-labeled sentiments.
2.  **Text Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Applied a series of NLP techniques to clean and normalize the text data.
3.  **Feature Extraction (Word Embeddings):** Trained a Word2Vec model on the cleaned corpus to generate dense vector embeddings for each word.
4.  **Model Building:** Constructed a Bi-LSTM model using Keras, designed to process sequential data effectively.
5.  **Model Training & Evaluation:** Trained the model on the processed data and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6.  **Sentiment Prediction:** The final trained model is capable of predicting the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

## ðŸ”® Future Learning & Improvements

As this project was focused on learning, there are several exciting avenues for future development and further skill-building:

* **Deployment:** Containerize the application with Docker and deploy the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI to learn MLOps principles.
* **Experiment with Transformers:** Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model like BERT or RoBERTa to compare its performance against the Bi-LSTM.
* **Expand to Multi-Class Classification:** Enhance the model to detect more nuanced emotions like joy, anger, sadness, or neutral sentiment.
